# Advent of Code 2023

Another Year, Another Try! But Remember - Rust or Die! Muahahahaa!

As every year, I try to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
Last year I tried Rust, gave up after day 12, and switched to GO.

This year, I try harder - I want to learn Rust for real, so let's see if I get it this year.

Take this repo as inspiration, deterrence, ideas, if you like.

Happy coding!
